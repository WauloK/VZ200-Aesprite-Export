# VZ200-Aseprite-Export
LUA script to export sprite data to VZ200 format

VZ200 sprite data export by Jason "WauloK" Oakley
https://www.BlueBilby.com/

Based on Gameboy export code from
https://github.com/boombuler/aseprite-gbexport/blob/master/GameboyExport.lua

May also work for other Motorola 6847 based graphics chip computers

Place this file in the Aseprite scripts directory.
Usually on Windows: %APPDATA%\Aseprite\scripts

I've also included the Indexed palette to use.
Load it in Aseprite.
